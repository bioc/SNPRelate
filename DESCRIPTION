Description: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are widely used to
        investigate the genetic basis of diseases and traits, but they
        pose many computational challenges. We developed an R package
        SNPRelate to provide a binary format for single-nucleotide
        polymorphism (SNP) data in GWAS utilizing CoreArray Genomic
        Data Structure (GDS) data files. The GDS format offers the
        efficient operations specifically designed for integers with
        two bits, since a SNP could occupy only two bits. SNPRelate is
        also designed to accelerate two key computations on SNP data
        using parallel computing for multi-core symmetric
        multiprocessing computer architectures: Principal Component
        Analysis (PCA) and relatedness analysis using
        Identity-By-Descent measures. The SNP format in this package is
        also being used by the GWASTools package with the support of S4
        classes and generic functions.
